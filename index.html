                    <li>Studied at Cambridge and Princeton from 1931 to 1938</li>
                    <li>In 1936, while studying at Cambridge, Turing published a landmark paper about probability. In it, he defines the <button id="pagetransition" style="font-size: 32px;">Turing Machine</button></li>

            <p style="font-size: 32px;">
                A machine that could solve any math equation given an infinitely long tape with boxes in it that either said 1 and 0 by overwriting values on different positions on the tape given the current value the reader was over <br>
                It was the first description of a machine that could be programmed. Modern computers today are all Turing machines that toggle on and off 1's and 0's in a sequence. For this, Turing is known as the father of the modern computer

                    <p style="font-size: 32px;">
                        During World War II, Alan Turing was tasked by the British to crack Germany's Enigma Code. In Naval warfare, the Germans were sending encrypted messages that contained sensitive combat information using the Enigma Machine. The Enigma Code was a nearly unbreakable cipher that outputted a different character given the same input with 3 knobs that can alter the nature of the encryption.<br>
                        His work shortened the war by years and it's estimated he saved 15+ million lives.

                <li>It was designed with performance in mind, earning it the spot as the fastest computer in the world (1 MHz memory) for several years</li>

            Alan Turing was put on trial by the British government for gross indecency with another male and he was forced to take organo-therapy to supress his homosexuality. In June 7, 1954, Alan Turing was was found dead with a bitten apple at his side.<br><br>
            It was assumed that he committed suicide in eating a cyanide poisoned apple over his predicament, however this view has been challenged in recent years. Historians now consider the possibility that he died through the inhalation of cyanide fumes in his room.<br><br>
            In 2013, Alan Turing posthumously recieved a royal pardon as part of the "Alan Turing Law" in the Policing and Crime Act of 2017 which overruled his 1954 sentence in addition to every other homosexual conviction.<br><br>

            Alan Turing stands as a gay hero in history who helped save countless lives and founded one of the most important fields of study today.<br><br>
            His work in cracking German codes gave the Allies a tactical edge in naval combat, shortening the war and saving millions of lives.<br><br>
            The Turing Machine served as a blueprint for the basis of modern computers and the very concept of programming.<br><br>
            He will be remembered as an innovator who wasnâ€™t afraid to break social and technological boundaries.<br><br>
            His voice needs to be heard as the man who saved millions, kickstarted the technological revolution, and is an LGBTW icon.
